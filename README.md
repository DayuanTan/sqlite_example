It doesn't support use alone in frontend/web browser. It needs a backend server.

Refer:

```
However, there are certain more ways to store your data in your browsers' local database. You may use these:
Indexed DB - W3C Recommendation 08 January 2015
WebSQL - It is no longer in active maintenance and the Web Applications Working Group does not intend to maintain it further.
Although Safari does not yet support Indexed DB, but hopefully in near future it will be supported by all major browsers.
